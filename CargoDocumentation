cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo

The first command creates a new directory and project called hello_cargo. 
We’ve named our project hello_cargo, and Cargo creates its files in a directory of the same name.

Go into the hello_cargo directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo has generated two files and one directory for us: a Cargo.toml file and a src directory with a main.rs file inside.

This file is in the TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which is Cargo’s configuration format.
